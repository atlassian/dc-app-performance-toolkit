However, if you already have Python installed, you can install Taurus manually with pip, Python package manager.

#### Installing Taurus manually

```
python --version or python3 --version
pip --version
java -version
Microsoft Visual C++ 14
```
Check that Chrome browser version is 76.

Make sure you have Visual Studio build tool v14.22 installed.

cd jira
bzt-pip install setuptools wheel
bzt-pip install -r requirements.txt
