# Data Center App Performance Toolkit User Guide For Bamboo

This document walks you through the process of testing your app on Bamboo using the Data Center App Performance Toolkit. 
These instructions focus on producing the required 
[performance and scale benchmarks for your Data Center app](/platform/marketplace/dc-apps-performance-and-scale-testing/).

In this document, we cover the use of the Data Center App Performance Toolkit on Enterprise-scale environment.

**Enterprise-scale environment**: Bamboo Data Center environment used to generate Data Center App Performance Toolkit 
test results for the Marketplace approval process. Preferably, use the below recommended parameters.

1. [Set up an enterprise-scale environment Bamboo Data Center on AWS](#instancesetup).
2. [Load an enterprise-scale dataset on your Bamboo Data Center deployment](#preloading).
3. [App-specific actions development](#appspecificaction).   
4. [Set up an execution environment for the toolkit](#executionhost).
5. [Running the test scenarios from execution environment against enterprise-scale Bamboo Data Center](#testscenario).

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services running during the reference deployment. For more information, 
go to [aws.amazon.com/pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/).
{{% /note %}}

To reduce costs, we recommend you to keep your deployment up and running only during the performance runs.

#### AWS cost estimation
[AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/) provides an estimate of usage charges for AWS services based on certain information you provide.
Monthly charges will be based on your actual usage of AWS services and may vary from the estimates the Calculator has provided.

*The prices below are approximate and may vary depending on such factors like region, instance type, deployment type of DB, and other.  


| Stack | Estimated hourly cost ($) |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| One Node Bamboo DC + Agents instance | 0.7 - 0.8

#### Stop Bamboo instance and Agents instance

To reduce AWS infrastructure costs you could stop bamboo node or agents instance in AWS EC2 console:

1. Go to EC2 **Instances**, select instance, click **Instance state** > **Stop instance**.

To return node into a working state follow the instructions:  

1. Go to EC2 **Instances**, select instance, click **Instance state** > **Start instance**, wait a few minutes for node to become available.

#### Stop database

To reduce AWS infrastructure costs database could be stopped when the cluster is standing idle.
Keep in mind that database would be **automatically started** in **7** days.

To stop database:

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **RDS** > **Databases**.
1. Select cluster database.
1. Click on **Actions** > **Stop**.

To start database:

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **RDS** > **Databases**.
1. Select cluster database.
1. Click on **Actions** > **Start**.

## <a id="appspecificaction"></a>3. App-specific actions development

Data Center App Performance Toolkit has its own set of default test actions: 
 - JMeter: for load at scale generation
 - Selenium: for UI timings measuring 
 - Locust: for defined parallel Bamboo plans execution     

**App-specific action** - action (performance test) you have to develop to cover main use cases of your application. 
Performance test should focus on the common usage of your application and not to cover all possible functionality of 
your app. For example, application setup screen or other one-time use cases are out of scope of performance testing.

### App specific dataset extension
If your app introduces new functionality for Bamboo entities, for example new task, it is important to extend base 
dataset with your app specific functionality.

1. Open `app/util/bamboo/bamboo_dataset_generator/src/main/java/bamboogenerator/Main.java` and set:
   - `BAMBOO_SERVER_URL`: url of Bamboo stack
   - `ADMIN_USER_NAME`: username of admin user (default is `admin`)
1. Login as `ADMIN_USER_NAME`, go to **Profile &gt; Personal access tokens** and create a new token with the same 
permissions as admin user.
1. Run following command:
    ``` bash
    export BAMBOO_TOKEN=newly_generarted_token  # for MacOS and Linux
    ```
    or
    ``` bash
    set BAMBOO_TOKEN newly_generarted_token     # for Windows
    ```
1. Open `app/util/bamboo/bamboo_dataset_generator/src/main/java/bamboogenerator/service/generator/plan/PlanGenerator.java` 
file and modify plan template according to your app. e.g. add new task.
1. Navigate to `app/util/bamboo/bamboo_dataset_generator` and start generation:
    ``` bash
    ./run.sh     # for MacOS and Linux
    ```
    or
    ``` bash
    run          # for Windows
    ```
1. Login into Bamboo UI and make sure that plan configurations were updated.
1. Default duration of the plan is 60 seconds. Measure plan duration with new app-specific functionality and modify
   `default_dataset_plan_duration` value accordingly in `bamboo.yml` file.

   For example, if plan duration with app-specific task became 70 seconds, than `default_dataset_plan_duration`
   should be set to 70 seconds in `bamboo.yml` file.

### Example of app-specific Selenium action development
For example, you develop an app that adds some additional UI elements to view plan summary page. 
In this case, you should develop Selenium app-specific action:

1. Extend example of app-specific action in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/extension/bamboo/extension_ui.py`.  
[Code example.](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/extension/bamboo/extension_ui.py)
So, our test has to open plan summary page and measure time to load of this new app-specific element on the page.
1. If you need to run `app_specific_action` as specific user uncomment `app_specific_user_login` function in 
   [code example](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/extension/bamboo/extension_ui.py). 
   Note, that in this case `test_1_selenium_custom_action` should follow just before `test_2_selenium_z_log_out` action.
1. In `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/selenium_ui/bamboo_ui.py`, review and uncomment the following block of code to make newly created app-specific actions executed:

   ``` python
   # def test_1_selenium_custom_action(webdriver, datasets, screen_shots):
   #     app_specific_action(webdriver, datasets)
   ```
1. Run toolkit with `bzt bamboo.yml` command to ensure that all Selenium actions including `app_specific_action` are successful.

### Example of JMeter app-specific action development

1. Check that `bamboo.yml` file has correct settings of `application_hostname`, `application_protocol`, `application_port`, `application_postfix`, etc.
1. Set desired execution percentage for `standalone_extension`. Default value is `0`, which means that `standalone_extension` action will not be executed. 
For example, for app-specific action development you could set percentage of `standalone_extension` to 100 and for all 
   other actions to 0 - this way only `login_and_view_all_builds` and `standalone_extension` actions would be executed.
1. Navigate to `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app` folder and run from virtualenv(as described in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/README.md`):
    
    ```python util/jmeter/start_jmeter_ui.py --app bamboo```
    
1. Open `Bamboo` thread group > `actions per login` and navigate to `standalone_extension`
1. Review existing stabs of `jmeter_app_specific_action`: 
   - example GET request
   - example POST request
   - example extraction of variables from the response - `app_id` and `app_token`
   - example assertions of GET and POST requests
1. Modify examples or add new controllers according to your app main use case.
1. Right-click on `View Results Tree` and enable this controller.
1. Click **Start** button and make sure that `login_and_view_dashboard` and `standalone_extension` are executed.
1. Right-click on `View Results Tree` and disable this controller. It is important to disable `View Results Tree` controller before full-scale results generation.
1. Click **Save** button.
1. To make `standalone_extension` executable during toolkit run edit `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/bamboo.yml` and set 
   execution percentage of `standalone_extension` accordingly to your use case frequency.
1. App-specific tests could be run (if needed) as a specific user. In the `standalone_extension` uncomment 
   `login_as_specific_user` controller. Navigate to the `username:password` config element and update values for 
   `app_specific_username` and `app_specific_password` names with your specific user credentials. Also make sure that 
   you located your app-specific tests between `login_as_specific_user` and 
   `login_as_default_user_if_specific_user_was_loggedin` controllers.
1. Run toolkit to ensure that all JMeter actions including `standalone_extension` are successful.

## <a id="executionhost"></a>4. Setting up an execution environment

For generating performance results suitable for Marketplace approval process use dedicated execution environment. This 
is a separate AWS EC2 instance to run the toolkit from. Running the toolkit from a dedicated instance but not from a 
local machine eliminates network fluctuations and guarantees stable CPU and memory performance.

1. Go to GitHub and create a fork of [dc-app-performance-toolkit](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit).
1. Clone the fork locally, then edit the `bamboo.yml` configuration file. Set enterprise-scale Bamboo Data Center parameters:

   ``` yaml
    application_hostname: bamboo_host_name or public_ip   # Bamboo DC hostname without protocol and port e.g. test-bamboo.atlassian.com or localhost
    application_protocol: http          # http or https
    application_port: 8085              # 80, 443, 8080, 8085, etc
    secure: True                        # Set False to allow insecure connections, e.g. when using self-signed SSL certificate
    application_postfix:                # e.g. /babmoo in case of url like http://localhost:8085/bamboo
    admin_login: admin
    admin_password: admin
    load_executor: jmeter            
    concurrency: 200                    # number of concurrent threads to authenticate random users
    test_duration: 45m
    ramp-up: 3m
    total_actions_per_hour: 2000        # number of total JMeter actions per hour
    number_of_agents: 50                # number of available remote agents
    parallel_plans_count: 40            # number of parallel plans execution
    start_plan_timeout: 60              # maximum timeout of plan to start
    default_dataset_plan_duration: 60   # expected plan execution duration
   ```  

1. Push your changes to the forked repository.
1. [Launch AWS EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstarts/latest/vmlaunch/step-1-launch-instance.html). 
   * OS: select from Quick Start `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS`.
   * Instance type: [`c5.2xlarge`](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/)
   * Storage size: `30` GiB
1. Connect to the instance using [SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) 
   or the [AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html).

   ```bash
   ssh -i path_to_pem_file ubuntu@INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository). Setup manage Docker 
   as a [non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall).
1. Clone forked repository.


You'll need to run the toolkit for each [test scenario](#testscenario) in the next section.

##### Generating a Bamboo performance regression report

To generate a performance regression report:  

1. Use SSH to connect to execution environment.
1. Install and activate the `virtualenv` as described in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/README.md`
1. Allow current user (for execution environment default user is `ubuntu`) to access Docker generated reports:
   ``` bash
   sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results
   ```
1. Navigate to the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/reports_generation` folder.
1. Edit the `bamboo_profile.yml` file:
    - Under `runName: "without app"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 1](#regressionrun1).
    - Under `runName: "with app"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 2](#regressionrun2).
    - Under `runName: "with app and app-specific actions"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 3](#run3).    
1. Run the following command:
    ``` bash
    python csv_chart_generator.py bamboo_profile.yml
    ```
1. In the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/reports/YY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss` folder, view the `.csv` file 
   (with consolidated scenario results), the `.png` chart file and bamboo performance scenario summary report.

#### Analyzing report

Use [scp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html) command to copy report artifacts from execution env to local drive:

1. From local machine terminal (Git bash terminal for Windows) run command:
   
   ``` bash
   export EXEC_ENV_PUBLIC_IP=execution_environment_ec2_instance_public_ip
   scp -r -i path_to_exec_env_pem ubuntu@$EXEC_ENV_PUBLIC_IP:/home/ubuntu/dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/reports ./reports
   ```
   
1. Once completed, in the `./reports` folder you will be able to review the action timings with and without your app to 
   see its impact on the performance of the instance. If you see an impact (>20%) on any action timing, we recommend 
   taking a look into the app implementation to understand the root cause of this delta.
   
#### Attaching testing results to DCHELP ticket

{{% warning %}}
Do not forget to attach performance testing results to your DCHELP ticket.
{{% /warning %}}

1. Make sure you have report folder with bamboo performance scenario results. 
   Folder should have `profile.csv`, `profile.png`, `profile_summary.log` and profile run result archives.
1. Attach report folder to your DCHELP ticket.
