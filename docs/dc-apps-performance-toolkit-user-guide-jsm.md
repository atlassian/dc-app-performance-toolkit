# Data Center App Performance Toolkit User Guide For Jira Service Management

This document walks you through the process of testing your app on Jira Service Management using the Data Center App Performance Toolkit. These instructions focus on producing the required [performance and scale benchmarks for your Data Center app](/platform/marketplace/dc-apps-performance-and-scale-testing/).

In this document, we cover the use of the Data Center App Performance Toolkit on two types of environments:

**[Development environment](#mainenvironmentdev)**: Jira Service Management Data Center environment for a test run of Data Center App Performance Toolkit and development of [app-specific actions](#appspecificactions). We recommend you use the [AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) with the parameters prescribed here.

1. [Set up a development environment Jira Service Management Data Center on AWS](#devinstancesetup).
2. [Load a "small" dataset for the development environment](#devdataset).
3. [Run toolkit on the development environment locally](#devtestscenario).
4. [Develop and test app-specific actions locally](#devappaction).

**[Enterprise-scale environment](#mainenvironmententerprise)**: Jira Service Management Data Center environment used to generate Data Center App Performance Toolkit test results for the Marketplace approval process. Preferably, use the [AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) with the parameters prescribed below. These parameters provision larger, more powerful infrastructure for your Jira Service Management Data Center.

5. [Set up an enterprise-scale environment Jira Service Management Data Center on AWS](#instancesetup).
6. [Load an enterprise-scale dataset on your Jira Service Management Data Center deployment](#preloading).
7. [Set up an execution environment for the toolkit](#executionhost).
8. [Running the test scenarios from execution environment against enterprise-scale Jira Service Management Data Center](#testscenario).

## <a id="mainenvironmentdev"></a>Development environment

Running the tests in a development environment helps familiarize you with the toolkit. It'll also provide you with a lightweight and less expensive environment for developing. Once you're ready to generate test results for the Marketplace Data Center Apps Approval process, run the toolkit in an **enterprise-scale environment**.

### <a id="devinstancesetup"></a>1. Setting up Jira Service Management Data Center development environment

We recommend that you set up development environment using the [AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) (**How to deploy** tab). All the instructions on this page are optimized for AWS. 


#### Using the AWS Quick Start for Jira Service Management

If you are a new user, perform an end-to-end deployment. This involves deploying Jira Service Management into a _new_ ASI:

Navigate to **[AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) &gt; How to deploy** tab **&gt; Deploy into a new ASI** link.

If you have already deployed the ASI separately by using the [ASI Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/atlassian-standard-infrastructure/)ASI Quick Start or by deploying another Atlassian product (Jira, Bitbucket, or Confluence Data Center development environment) with ASI, deploy Jira Service Management into your existing ASI:

Navigate to **[AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) &gt; How to deploy** tab **&gt; Deploy into your existing ASI** link.

{{% note %}}
You are responsible for the cost of AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. This Quick Start doesn't have any additional prices. See [Amazon EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) for more detail.
{{% /note %}}

To reduce costs, we recommend you to keep your deployment up and running only during the performance runs.

#### AWS cost estimation for the development environment

AWS Jira Service Management Data Center development environment infrastructure costs about 25 - 50$ per working week depending on such factors like region, instance type, deployment type of DB, and other.

### <a id="devdataset"></a>2. Upload "small" dataset for development environment  

You can load this dataset directly into the database (via a [populate_db.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh) script), or import it via XML.  

##### Option 1 (recommended): Loading the "small" dataset via populate_db.sh script

To populate the database with SQL:

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **EC2** > **Instances**.
1. On the **Description** tab, do the following:
    - Copy the _Public IP_ of the Bastion instance.
    - Copy the _Private IP_ of the Jira Service Management node instance.
1. Using SSH, connect to the Jira Service Management node via the Bastion instance:
  
    For Linux or MacOS run following commands in terminal (for Windows use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) terminal):
    
    ```bash
    ssh-add path_to_your_private_key_pem
    export BASTION_IP=bastion_instance_public_ip
    export NODE_IP=node_private_ip
    export SSH_OPTS1='-o ServerAliveInterval=60'
    export SSH_OPTS2='-o ServerAliveCountMax=30'
    ssh ${SSH_OPTS1} ${SSH_OPTS2} -o "proxycommand ssh -W %h:%p ${SSH_OPTS1} ${SSH_OPTS2} ec2-user@${BASTION_IP}" ec2-user@${NODE_IP}
    ```
    For more information, go to [Connecting your nodes over SSH](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/administering-jira-data-center-on-aws-938846969.html#AdministeringJiraDataCenteronAWS-ConnectingtoyournodesoverSSH).
1. Download the [populate_db.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh) script and make it executable:

    ``` bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh && chmod +x populate_db.sh
    ```
1. Review the following `Variables section` of the script:

    ``` bash
    DB_CONFIG="/var/atlassian/application-data/jira/dbconfig.xml"
    JIRA_DB_NAME="jira"
    JIRA_DB_USER="postgres"
    JIRA_DB_PASS="Password1!"
    # JSM section
    JIRA_CURRENT_DIR="/opt/atlassian/jira-servicedesk/current"
    JIRA_SETENV_FILE="${JIRA_CURRENT_DIR}/bin/setenv.sh"

### <a id="devtestscenario"></a>3. Run toolkit on the development environment locally

{{% warning %}}
Make sure **English (United States)** language is selected as a default language on the **![cog icon](/platform/marketplace/images/cog.png) &gt; System &gt; General configuration** page. Other languages are **not supported** by the toolkit.
{{% /warning %}}

1. Clone [Data Center App Performance Toolkit](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit) locally.
1. Follow the [README.md](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/README.md) instructions to set up toolkit locally.
1. Navigate to `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app` folder.
1. Open the `jsm.yml` file and fill in the following variables:
    - `application_hostname`: your_dc_jsm_instance_hostname without protocol.
    - `application_protocol`: http or https.
    - `application_port`: for HTTP - 80, for HTTPS - 443, 8080, 2990 or your instance-specific port.
    - `secure`: True or False. Default value is True. Set False to allow insecure connections, e.g. when using self-signed SSL certificate.
    - `application_postfix`: it is empty by default; e.g., /jira for url like this http://localhost:2990/jira.
    - `admin_login`: admin user username.
    - `admin_password`: admin user password.
    - `load_executor`: executor for load tests. Valid options are [jmeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) (default) or [locust](https://locust.io/).
    - `concurrency_agents`: `1` - number of concurrent JMeter/Locust agents.
    - `concurrency_customers`: `1` - number of concurrent JMeter/Locust customers.
    - `test_duration`: `5m` - duration of the performance run.
    - `ramp-up`: `3s` - amount of time it will take JMeter or Locust to add all test users to test execution.
    - `total_actions_per_hour_agents`: `500` - number of total JMeter/Locust actions per hour for agents scenario.
    - `total_actions_per_hour_customers`: `1500` - number of total JMeter/Locust actions per hour customers scenario.
    - `WEBDRIVER_VISIBLE`: visibility of Chrome browser during selenium execution (False is by default).
    
1. Run bzt.

    ``` bash
    bzt jsm.yml
    ```

1. Review the resulting table in the console log. All JMeter/Locust and Selenium actions should have 95+% success rate.  
In case some actions does not have 95+% success rate refer to the following logs in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/jsm/YY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss` folder:

    - `results_summary.log`: detailed run summary
    - `results.csv`: aggregated .csv file with all actions and timings
    - `bzt.log`: logs of the Taurus tool execution
    - `jmeter.*`: logs of the JMeter tool execution
    - `locust.*`: logs of the Locust tool execution (in case you use Locust as load_executor in jsm.yml)
    - `pytest.*`: logs of Pytest-Selenium execution

{{% warning %}}
Do not proceed with the next step until you have all actions 95+% success rate. Ask [support](#support) if above logs analysis did not help.

### <a id="devappaction"></a>4. Develop and test app-specific action locally
Data Center App Performance Toolkit has its own set of default test actions for Jira Service Management Data Center: JMeter/Locust and Selenium for load and UI tests respectively.     

**App-specific action** - action (performance test) you have to develop to cover main use cases of your application. Performance test should focus on the common usage of your application and not to cover all possible functionality of your app. For example, application setup screen or other one-time use cases are out of scope of performance testing.

1. Define main use case of your app. Usually it is one or two main app use cases.
1. Your app adds new UI elements in Jira Service Management Data Center - Selenium app-specific action has to be developed.
1. Your app introduces new endpoint or extensively calls existing Jira Service Management Data Center API - JMeter/Locust app-specific actions has to be developed.  
JMeter and Locust actions are interchangeable, so you could select the tool you prefer:

- JMeter - UI-based [performance tool](https://jmeter.apache.org/).
- Locust - code-based (Python requests library) [performance tool](https://locust.io/).


{{% note %}}
We strongly recommend developing your app-specific actions on the development environment to reduce AWS infrastructure costs.
{{% /note %}}


#### Custom dataset
You can filter your own app-specific issues for your app-specific actions.

1. Create app-specific service desk requests that have specific anchor in summary, e.g. *AppRequest* anchor and issues summaries like *AppRequest1*, *AppRequest2*, *AppRequest3*.
1. Go to the search page of your Jira Service Management Data Center - `JSM_URL/issues/?jql=` and select `Advanced`.
1. Write [JQL](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/jql-the-most-flexible-way-to-search-jira-14) that filter just your request from step 1, e.g. `summary ~ 'AppRequest*'`.
1. Edit JSM configuration file `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/jsm.yml`:  
    - `custom_dataset_query:` JQL from step 3.

Next time when you run toolkit, custom dataset issues will be stored to the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/datasets/jsm/custom-requests.csv` with columns: `request_id`, `request_key`, `service_desk_id`, `project_id`, `project_key`.

#### Example of app-specific Selenium action development with custom dataset  
You develop an app that adds some additional fields to specific types of Jira Service Management requests. In this case, you should develop Selenium app-specific action:

1. Create app-specific service desk requests with *AppRequest* anchor in summary: *AppRequest1*, *AppRequest2*, etc.
1. Go to the search page of your Jira Service Management Data Center - `JSM_URL/issues/?jql=` and check if JQL is correct: `summary  ~ 'AppRequest*'`.
1. Edit `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/jsm.yml` configuration file and set `custom_dataset_query: summary  ~ 'AppRequest*'`.
1. Extend example of app-specific action for agent in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/extension/jsm/extension_ui_agents.py`.  
[Code example.](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/extension/jsm/extension_ui_agents.py)
So, our test has to open app-specific requests in agent view and measure time to load of this app-specific request.
1. Extend example of app-specific action for customer in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/extension/jsm/extension_ui_customers.py`.  
[Code example.](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/extension/jsm/extension_ui_customers.py)
So, our test has to open app-specific requests in portal view and measure time to load of this app-specific request.
1. If you need to run `app_speicifc_action` as specific user uncomment `app_specific_user_login` function in [code example](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/extension/jsm/extension_ui_agents.py). Note, that in this case `test_1_selenium_custom_action` should follow just before `test_2_selenium_agent_z_logout` or `test_2_selenium_customer_z_log_out` action.
1. In `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/selenium_ui/jsm_ui_agents.py`, review and uncomment the following block of code to make newly created app-specific actions executed:
``` python
# def test_1_selenium_agent_custom_action(jsm_webdriver, jsm_datasets, jsm_screen_shots):
#     extension_ui_agents.app_specific_action(jsm_webdriver, jsm_datasets)
```

1. In `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/selenium_ui/jsm_ui_customers.py`, review and uncomment the following block of code to make newly created app-specific actions executed:
``` python
# def test_1_selenium_customer_custom_action(jsm_webdriver, jsm_datasets, jsm_screen_shots):
#     extension_ui_customers.app_specific_action(jsm_webdriver, jsm_datasets)
```

1. Run toolkit with `bzt jsm.yml` command to ensure that all Selenium actions including `app_specific_action` are successful.

#### Example of app-specific Locust/JMeter action development

You develop an app that introduces new GET and POST endpoints in Jira Service Management Data Center. In this case, you should develop Locust or JMeter app-specific action.

**Locust app-specific action development example**

1. Extend example of app-specific action for agent in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/extension/jsm/extension_locust_agents.py`, so that test will call the endpoint with GET request, parse response use these data to call another endpoint with POST request and measure response time.  
[Code example.](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/extension/jsm/extension_locust_agents.py)
1. Extend example of app-specific action for customers in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/extension/jsm/extension_locust_customers.py`, so that test will call the endpoint with GET request, parse response use these data to call another endpoint with POST request and measure response time.  
[Code example.](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/extension/jsm/extension_locust_customers.py)
1. In `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/jsm.yml` set `load_executor: locust` to make `locust` as load executor.
1. Set desired execution percentage for `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension`. Default value is `0`, which means that `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension` action will not be executed. Locust uses actions percentage as relative [weights](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/writing-a-locustfile.html#weight-attribute), so if `some_action: 10` and `standalone_extension: 20` that means that `standalone_extension` will be called twice more.  
Set `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension` weight in accordance with the expected frequency of your app use case compared with other base actions.
1. App-specific tests could be run (if needed) as a specific user. Use `@run_as_specific_user(username='specific_user_username', password='specific_user_password')` decorator for that.
1. Run toolkit with `bzt jsm.yml` command to ensure that all Locust actions including `app_specific_action` are successful.

**JMeter app-specific action development example**

1. Check that `jsm.yml` file has correct settings of `application_hostname`, `application_protocol`, `application_port`, `application_postfix`, etc.
1. Set desired execution percentage for `agent_standalone_extension` and/or `customer_standalone_extension`. Default values are `0`, which means that `agent_standalone_extension` and `customer_standalone_extension` actions will not be executed. 
For example, for app-specific action development you could set percentage of `agent_standalone_extension` and/or `customer_standalone_extension` to 100 and for all other actions to 0 - this way only `jmeter_agent_login_and_view_dashboard` and `agent_standalone_extension` or `jmeter_customer_login_and_view_dashboard` and `customer_standalone_extension` actions would be executed.
1. Navigate to `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app` folder and run from virtualenv(as described in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/README.md`):
    
    ``` bash
    python util/jmeter/start_jmeter_ui.py --app jsm --type agents
    # or
    python util/jmeter/start_jmeter_ui.py --app jsm --type customers  
    ```

1. Open `Agents`/`Customers` thread group > `actions per login` and navigate to `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension`
![Jira Service Management JMeter standalone extension](/platform/marketplace/images/jsm-standalone-extension.png)
1. Add GET `HTTP Request`: right-click to `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension`` > `Add` > `Sampler` `HTTP Request`, chose method GET and set endpoint in Path.
![Jira Service Management JMeter standalone GET](/platform/marketplace/images/jsm-standalone-get-request.png)
1. Add `Regular Expression Extractor`: right-click to to newly created `HTTP Request` > `Add` > `Post processor` > `Regular Expression Extractor`
![Jira Service Management JMeter standalone regexp](/platform/marketplace/images/jsm-standalone-regexp.png)
1. Add `Response Assertion`: right-click to newly created `HTTP Request` > `Add` > `Assertions` > `Response Assertion` and add assertion with `Contains`, `Matches`, `Equals`, etc types.
![Jira Service Management JMeter standalone assertions](/platform/marketplace/images/jsm-standalone-assertions.png)
1. Add POST `HTTP Request`: right-click to `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension` > `Add` > `Sampler` `HTTP Request`, chose method POST, set endpoint in Path and add Parameters or Body Data if needed.
1. Right-click on `View Results Tree` and enable this controller.
1. Click **Start** button and make sure that `login_and_view_dashboard` and `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension` are successful.
1. Right-click on `View Results Tree` and disable this controller. It is important to disable `View Results Tree` controller before full-scale results generation.
1. Click **Save** button.
1. To make `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension` executable during toolkit run edit `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/jsm.yml` and set execution percentage of `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension` accordingly to your use case frequency.
1. App-specific tests could be run (if needed) as a specific user. In the `agent_standalone_extension`/`customer_standalone_extension` uncomment `login_as_specific_user` controller. Navigate to the `username:password` config element and update values for `app_specific_username` and `app_specific_password` names with your specific user credentials. Also make sure that you located your app-specific tests between `login_as_specific_user` and `login_as_default_user_if_specific_user_was_loggedin` controllers.
1. Run toolkit to ensure that all JMeter actions including `agent_standalone_extension` and/or `customer_standalone_extension` are successful.

## <a id="mainenvironmententerprise"></a> Enterprise-scale environment

After adding your custom app-specific actions, you should now be ready to run the required tests for the Marketplace Data Center Apps Approval process. To do this, you'll need an **enterprise-scale environment**.

### <a id="instancesetup"></a>5. Set up an enterprise-scale environment Jira Service Management Data Center on AWS

We recommend that you use the [AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) (**How to deploy** tab)  to deploy a Jira Service Management Data Center enterprise-scale environment. This Quick Start will allow you to deploy Jira Service Management Data Center with a new [Atlassian Standard Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/atlassian-standard-infrastructure/) (ASI) or into an existing one.

The ASI is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) consisting of subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components required by all Atlassian applications, and then deploys Jira Service Management into this new VPC. Deploying Jira Service Management with a new ASI takes around 50 minutes. With an existing one, it'll take around 30 minutes.

#### Using the AWS Quick Start for Jira Service Management

If you are a new user, perform an end-to-end deployment. This involves deploying Jira Service Management into a _new_ ASI:

Navigate to **[AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) &gt; How to deploy** tab **&gt; Deploy into a new ASI** link.

If you have already deployed the ASI separately by using the [ASI Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/atlassian-standard-infrastructure/)ASI Quick Start or by deploying another Atlassian product (Jira, Bitbucket, or Confluence Data Center development environment) with ASI, deploy Jira Service Management into your existing ASI:

Navigate to **[AWS Quick Start for Jira Data Center](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/jira/) &gt; How to deploy** tab **&gt; Deploy into your existing ASI** link.

{{% note %}}
You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional price for using this Quick Start. For more information, go to [aws.amazon.com/pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/).
{{% /note %}}

To reduce costs, we recommend you to keep your deployment up and running only during the performance runs.

#### AWS cost estimation
[AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/) provides an estimate of usage charges for AWS services based on certain information you provide.
Monthly charges will be based on your actual usage of AWS services and may vary from the estimates the Calculator has provided.

*The prices below are approximate and may vary depending on such factors like region, instance type, deployment type of DB, and other.  

| Stack | Estimated hourly cost ($) |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| One Node Jira Service Management DC | 0.8 - 1.1
| Two Nodes Jira Service Management DC | 1.2 - 1.7
| Four Nodes Jira Service Management DC | 2.0 - 3.0

#### Stop cluster nodes

To reduce AWS infrastructure costs you could stop cluster nodes when the cluster is standing idle.  
Cluster node might be stopped by using [Suspending and Resuming Scaling Processes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-suspend-resume-processes.html).

To stop one node within the cluster, follow the instructions below:

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **EC2** > **Auto Scaling Groups** and open the necessary group to which belongs the node you want to stop.
1. Click **Edit** (in case you have New EC2 experience UI mode enabled, press `Edit` on `Advanced configuration`) and add `HealthCheck` to the `Suspended Processes`. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling stops marking instances unhealthy as a result of EC2 and Elastic Load Balancing health checks.
1. Go to EC2 **Instances**, select instance, click **Instance state** > **Stop instance**.

To return node into a working state follow the instructions:  

1. Go to EC2 **Instances**, select instance, click **Instance state** > **Start instance**, wait a few minutes for node to become available.
1. Go to EC2 **Auto Scaling Groups** and open the necessary group to which belongs the node you want to start.
1. Press **Edit** (in case you have New EC2 experience UI mode enabled, press `Edit` on `Advanced configuration`) and remove `HealthCheck` from `Suspended Processes` of Auto Scaling Group.

#### Stop database

To reduce AWS infrastructure costs database could be stopped when the cluster is standing idle.
Keep in mind that database would be **automatically started** in **7** days.

To stop database:

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **RDS** > **Databases**.
1. Select cluster database.
1. Click on **Actions** > **Stop**.

To start database:

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **RDS** > **Databases**.
1. Select cluster database.
1. Click on **Actions** > **Start**.

#### <a id="quick-start-parameters"></a> Quick Start parameters

All important parameters are listed and described in this section. For all other remaining parameters, we recommend using the Quick Start defaults.

**Jira setup**

### <a id="preloading"></a>6. Preloading your Jira Service Management deployment with an enterprise-scale dataset

Data dimensions and values for an enterprise-scale dataset are listed and described in the following table.

| Data dimensions | Value for an enterprise-scale dataset |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Attachments | ~2 000 000 |
| Comments | ~2 000 000 |
| Components  | ~1 500 |
| Custom fields | ~400 |
| Organizations | ~300 |
| Requests | ~1 000 000 |
| Projects | 200 |
| Screen schemes | ~500 |
| Screens | ~3000 |
| Users | ~21 000 |
| Workflows | ~700 |

{{% note %}}
All the datasets use the standard `admin`/`admin` credentials.
{{% /note %}}

#### Pre-loading the dataset is a three-step process:

1. [Importing the main dataset](#importingdataset). To help you out, we provide an enterprise-scale dataset you can import either via the [populate_db.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh) script or restore from xml backup file.
1. [Restoring attachments](#copyingattachments). We also provide attachments, which you can pre-load via an [upload_attachments.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/upload_attachments.sh) script.
1. [Re-indexing Jira Data Center](#reindexing). For more information, go to [Re-indexing Jira](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/search-indexing-938847710.html).

The following subsections explain each step in greater detail.

#### <a id="importingdataset"></a> Importing the main dataset

You can load this dataset directly into the database (via a [populate_db.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh) script), or import it via XML.  

##### Option 1 (recommended): Loading the dataset via populate_db.sh script (~40 min)


To populate the database with SQL:

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **EC2** > **Instances**.
1. On the **Description** tab, do the following:
    - Copy the _Public IP_ of the Bastion instance.
    - Copy the _Private IP_ of the Jira Service Management node instance.
1. Using SSH, connect to the Jira Service Management node via the Bastion instance:

    For Linux or MacOS run following commands in terminal (for Windows use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) terminal):
    
    ```bash
    ssh-add path_to_your_private_key_pem
    export BASTION_IP=bastion_instance_public_ip
    export NODE_IP=node_private_ip
    export SSH_OPTS1='-o ServerAliveInterval=60'
    export SSH_OPTS2='-o ServerAliveCountMax=30'
    ssh ${SSH_OPTS1} ${SSH_OPTS2} -o "proxycommand ssh -W %h:%p ${SSH_OPTS1} ${SSH_OPTS2} ec2-user@${BASTION_IP}" ec2-user@${NODE_IP}
    ```
    For more information, go to [Connecting your nodes over SSH](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/administering-jira-data-center-on-aws-938846969.html#AdministeringJiraDataCenteronAWS-ConnectingtoyournodesoverSSH).
1. Download the [populate_db.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh) script and make it executable:

    ``` bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh && chmod +x populate_db.sh
    ```
1. Review the following `Variables section` of the script:

    ``` bash
    DB_CONFIG="/var/atlassian/application-data/jira/dbconfig.xml"
    JIRA_DB_NAME="jira"
    JIRA_DB_USER="postgres"
    JIRA_DB_PASS="Password1!"
    # JSM section
    JIRA_CURRENT_DIR="/opt/atlassian/jira-servicedesk/current"
    JIRA_SETENV_FILE="${JIRA_CURRENT_DIR}/bin/setenv.sh"
    JIRA_VERSION_FILE="/media/atl/jira/shared/jira-servicedesk.version"
    ```
1. Run the script:

    ``` bash
    ./populate_db.sh --jsm 2>&1 | tee -a populate_db.log
    ```

{{% note %}}
Do not close or interrupt the session. It will take about 40 min to restore SQL database. When SQL restoring is finished, an admin user will have `admin`/`admin` credentials.

In case of a failure, check the `Variables` section and run the script one more time.
{{% /note %}}

##### Option 2: Loading the dataset through XML import (~4 hours)

We recommend that you only use this method if you are having problems with the [populate_db.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/populate_db.sh) script.

1. In the AWS console, go to **Services** > **EC2** > **Instances**.
1. On the **Description** tab, do the following:
    - Copy the _Public IP_ of the Bastion instance.
    - Copy the _Private IP_ of the Jira Service Management node instance.
1. Using SSH, connect to the Jira Service Management node via the Bastion instance:

1. Download the xml_backup.zip file corresponding to your Jira Service Management version.

    ``` bash
    JSM_VERSION=$(sudo su jira -c "cat /media/atl/jira/shared/jira-servicedesk.version")
    sudo su jira -c "wget https://centaurus-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/jira/${JSM_VERSION}/large/xml_backup.zip -O /media/atl/jira/shared/import/xml_backup.zip"
    ```
1. Log in as a user with the **Jira System Administrators** [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-global-permissions-938847142.html).
1. Go to **![cog icon](/platform/marketplace/images/cog.png) &gt; System &gt; Restore System.** from the menu.
1. Populate the **File name** field with `xml_backup.zip`.
1. Click **Restore** and wait until the import is completed.

#### <a id="copyingattachments"></a> Restoring attachments (~2 hours)

After [Importing the main dataset](#importingdataset), you'll now have to pre-load an enterprise-scale set of attachments.

1. Download the [upload_attachments.sh](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/blob/master/app/util/jira/upload_attachments.sh) script and make it executable:

    ``` bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/master/app/util/jira/upload_attachments.sh && chmod +x upload_attachments.sh
    ```    
1. Review the following `Variables section` of the script:

    ``` bash
    # JSM version file location
    JIRA_VERSION_FILE="/media/atl/jira/shared/jira-servicedesk.version"
    ```
1. Run the script:

    ``` bash
    ./upload_attachments.sh --jsm 2>&1 | tee -a upload_attachments.log
    ```

{{% note %}}
Do not close or interrupt the session. It will take about two hours to upload attachments to Elastic File Storage (EFS).
{{% /note %}}

### <a id="executionhost"></a>7. Setting up an execution environment

For generating performance results suitable for Marketplace approval process use dedicated execution environment. This is a separate AWS EC2 instance to run the toolkit from. Running the toolkit from a dedicated instance but not from a local machine eliminates network fluctuations and guarantees stable CPU and memory performance.

1. Go to GitHub and create a fork of [dc-app-performance-toolkit](https://github.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit).
1. Clone the fork locally, then edit the `jsm.yml` configuration file. Set enterprise-scale Jira Service Management Data Center parameters:

{{% warning %}}
Do not push to the fork real `application_hostname`, `admin_login` and `admin_password` values for security reasons.
Instead, set those values directly in `.yml` file on execution environment instance.
{{% /warning %}}

   ``` yaml
       application_hostname: test_jsm_instance.atlassian.com   # Jira Service Management DC hostname without protocol and port e.g. test-jsm.atlassian.com or localhost
       application_protocol: http                # http or https
       application_port: 80                      # 80, 443, 8080, 2990, etc
       secure: True                              # Set False to allow insecure connections, e.g. when using self-signed SSL certificate
       application_postfix:                      # e.g. /jira in case of url like http://localhost:2990/jira

       total_actions_per_hour_customers: 15000   # number of total JMeter/Locust actions per hour
   ```  

1. Push your changes to the forked repository.
1. [Launch AWS EC2 instance](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/). 
   * OS: select from Quick Start `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS`.
   * Instance type: [`c5.2xlarge`](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/)
   * Storage size: `30` GiB
1. Connect to the instance using [SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) or the [AWS Systems Manager Sessions Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html).

   ```bash
   ssh -i path_to_pem_file ubuntu@INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository). Setup manage Docker as a [non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall).
1. Connect to the AWS EC2 instance and clone forked repository.

{{% note %}}
At this stage app-specific actions are not needed yet. Use code from `master` branch with your `jsm.yml` changes.

### <a id="testscenario"></a>8. Running the test scenarios from execution environment against enterprise-scale Jira Service Management Data Center

Using the Data Center App Performance Toolkit for [Performance and scale testing your Data Center app](/platform/marketplace/developing-apps-for-atlassian-data-center-products/) involves two test scenarios:

- [Performance regression](#testscenario1)
- [Scalability testing](#testscenario2)

Each scenario will involve multiple test runs. The following subsections explain both in greater detail.

#### <a id="testscenario1"></a> Scenario 1: Performance regression

This scenario helps to identify basic performance issues without a need to spin up a multi-node Jira Service Management DC. Make sure the app does not have any performance impact when it is not exercised.

##### <a id="regressionrun1"></a> Run 1 (~50 min)

To receive performance baseline results **without** an app installed:

1. Use SSH to connect to execution environment.
1. Run toolkit with docker from the execution environment instance:

    ``` bash
    cd dc-app-performance-toolkit
    docker pull atlassian/dcapt
    docker run --shm-size=4g -v "$PWD:/dc-app-performance-toolkit" atlassian/dcapt jsm.yml
    ```

1. View the following main results of the run in the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/jsm/YY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss` folder:
    - `results_summary.log`: detailed run summary
    - `results.csv`: aggregated .csv file with all actions and timings
    - `bzt.log`: logs of the Taurus tool execution
    - `jmeter.*`: logs of the JMeter tool execution
    - `pytest.*`: logs of Pytest-Selenium execution

{{% note %}}
Review `results_summary.log` file under artifacts dir location. Make sure that overall status is `OK` before moving to the next steps. For an enterprise-scale environment run, the acceptable success rate for actions is 95% and above.
{{% /note %}}

##### <a id="regressionrun2"></a> Run 2 (~50 min + Lucene Index timing test)

If you are submitting a Jira Service Management app, you are required to conduct a Lucene Index timing test. This involves conducting a foreground re-index on a single-node Data Center deployment (with your app installed) and a dataset that has 1M issues.

{{% note %}}
Index time for 1M issues on a User Guide [recommended configuration](#quick-start-parameters) is about ~30 min.
{{% /note %}}

{{% note %}}
If your Amazon RDS DB instance class is lower than `db.m5.xlarge` it is required to wait ~2 hours after previous reindex finish before starting a new one.
{{% /note %}}

**Benchmark your re-index time with your app installed:**

1. Install the app you want to test.
1. Setup app license.
1. Go to **![cog icon](/platform/marketplace/images/cog.png) &gt; System &gt; Indexing**.
1. Select the **Full re-index** option.
1. Click **Re-Index** and wait until re-indexing is completed.
1. **Take a screenshot of the acknowledgment screen** displaying the re-index time and Lucene index timing.
1. Attach the screenshot to your DCHELP ticket.

**Performance results generation with the app installed:**

1. Run toolkit with docker from the execution environment instance:

   ``` bash
   cd dc-app-performance-toolkit
   docker pull atlassian/dcapt
   docker run --shm-size=4g -v "$PWD:/dc-app-performance-toolkit" atlassian/dcapt jsm.yml
   ```

{{% note %}}
Review `results_summary.log` file under artifacts dir location. Make sure that overall status is `OK` before moving to the next steps. For an enterprise-scale environment run, the acceptable success rate for actions is 95% and above.

##### Generating a performance regression report

To generate a performance regression report:  

1. Use SSH to connect to execution environment.
1. Allow current user (for execution environment default user is `ubuntu`) to access Docker generated reports:
   ``` bash
   sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results
   ```
1. Install and activate the `virtualenv` as described in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/README.md`
1. Navigate to the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/reports_generation` folder.
1. Edit the `performance_profile.yml` file:
    - Under `runName: "without app"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 1](#regressionrun1).
    - Under `runName: "with app"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 2](#regressionrun2).
1. Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    python csv_chart_generator.py performance_profile.yml
    ```
1. In the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/reports/YY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss` folder, view the `.csv` file (with consolidated scenario results), the `.png` chart file and performance scenario summary report.

#### Analyzing report

Use [scp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html) command to copy report artifacts from execution env to local drive:

1. From local machine terminal (Git bash terminal for Windows) run command:
   ``` bash
   export EXEC_ENV_PUBLIC_IP=execution_environment_ec2_instance_public_ip
   scp -r -i path_to_exec_env_pem ubuntu@$EXEC_ENV_PUBLIC_IP:/home/ubuntu/dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/reports ./reports
   ```
1. Once completed, in the `./reports` folder you will be able to review the action timings with and without your app to see its impact on the performance of the instance. If you see an impact (>20%) on any action timing, we recommend taking a look into the app implementation to understand the root cause of this delta.

#### <a id="testscenario2"></a> Scenario 2: Scalability testing

The purpose of scalability testing is to reflect the impact on the customer experience when operating across multiple nodes. For this, you have to run scale testing on your app.

For many apps and extensions to Atlassian products, there should not be a significant performance difference between operating on a single node or across many nodes in Jira Service Management DC deployment. To demonstrate performance impacts of operating your app at scale, we recommend testing your Jira Service Management DC app in a cluster.


###### <a id="run3"></a> Run 3 (~50 min)

To receive scalability benchmark results for one-node Jira Service Management DC **with** app-specific actions:

1. Apply app-specific code changes to a new branch of forked repo.
1. Use SSH to connect to execution environment.
1. Pull cloned fork repo branch with app-specific actions.
1. Run toolkit with docker from the execution environment instance:

   ``` bash
   cd dc-app-performance-toolkit
   docker pull atlassian/dcapt
   docker run --shm-size=4g -v "$PWD:/dc-app-performance-toolkit" atlassian/dcapt jsm.yml
   ```

Before scaling your DC make sure that AWS vCPU limit is not lower than needed number. 
Use [vCPU limits calculator](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-on-demand-instance-vcpu-increase/) to see current limit.
The same article has instructions on how to increase limit if needed.

To receive scalability benchmark results for two-node Jira Service Management DC **with** app-specific actions:

1. In the AWS console, go to **CloudFormation** > **Stack details** > **Select your stack**.
1. On the **Update** tab, select **Use current template**, and then click **Next**.
1. Enter `2` in the **Maximum number of cluster nodes** and the **Minimum number of cluster nodes** fields.
1. Click **Next** > **Next** > **Update stack** and wait until stack is updated.
1. Make sure that Jira Service Management index successfully synchronized to the second node. To do that, use SSH to connect to the second node via Bastion (where `NODE_IP` is the IP of the second node):

    ```bash
    ssh-add path_to_your_private_key_pem
    export BASTION_IP=bastion_instance_public_ip
    export NODE_IP=node_private_ip
    export SSH_OPTS1='-o ServerAliveInterval=60'
    export SSH_OPTS2='-o ServerAliveCountMax=30'
    ssh ${SSH_OPTS1} ${SSH_OPTS2} -o "proxycommand ssh -W %h:%p ${SSH_OPTS1} ${SSH_OPTS2} ec2-user@${BASTION_IP}" ec2-user@${NODE_IP}
    ```
1. Once you're in the second node, download the [index-sync.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/master/app/util/jira/index-sync.sh) file. Then, make it executable and run it:

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atlassian/dc-app-performance-toolkit/master/app/util/jira/index-sync.sh && chmod +x index-sync.sh
    ./index-sync.sh 2>&1 | tee -a index-sync.log
    ```
    Index synchronizing time is about 5-10 minutes. When index synchronizing is successfully completed, the following lines will be displayed in console output:
    ```bash
    Index restore started
    indexes - 60%
    indexes - 80%
    indexes - 100%
    Index restore complete
    ```
   
{{% note %}}
If index synchronization is failed by some reason, you can manually copy index from the first node. To do it, login to the second node (use private browser window and check footer information to see which node is current), go to **System** > **Indexing**. In the **Copy the Search Index from another node**, choose the source node (first node) and the target node (current node). The index will copied from one instance to another.

#### Generating a report for scalability scenario

To generate a scalability report:

1. Use SSH to connect to execution environment.
1. Allow current user (for execution environment default user is `ubuntu`) to access Docker generated reports:
   ``` bash
   sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results
   ```
1. Navigate to the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/reports_generation` folder.
1. Edit the `scale_profile.yml` file:
    - For `runName: "1 Node"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 3](#run3).
    - For `runName: "2 Nodes"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 4](#run4).
    - For `runName: "4 Nodes"`, in the `fullPath` key, insert the full path to results directory of [Run 5](#run5).
1. Run the following command from the activated `virtualenv` (as described in `dc-app-performance-toolkit/README.md`):
    ``` bash
    python csv_chart_generator.py scale_profile.yml
    ```
1. In the `dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/reports/YY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss` folder, view the `.csv` file (with consolidated scenario results), the `.png` chart file and summary report.


#### Analyzing report

Use [scp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html) command to copy report artifacts from execution env to local drive:

1. From local terminal (Git bash terminal for Windows) run command:
   ``` bash
   export EXEC_ENV_PUBLIC_IP=execution_environment_ec2_instance_public_ip
   scp -r -i path_to_exec_env_pem ubuntu@$EXEC_ENV_PUBLIC_IP:/home/ubuntu/dc-app-performance-toolkit/app/results/reports ./reports
   ```
1. Once completed, in the `./reports` folder, you will be able to review action timings on Jira Service Management Data Center with different numbers of nodes. If you see a significant variation in any action timings between configurations, we recommend taking a look into the app implementation to understand the root cause of this delta.
