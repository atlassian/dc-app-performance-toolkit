# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to [DC App Performance Toolkit](README.md).
All the changes are welcome. Please help us to improve code, examples and documentation.


## Submitting changes
 
Pull requests, issues and comments are welcome. For pull requests:

  - Create your own fork of the repository and raise a pull request targeting `dev` branch in the main repository
  - Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests
  
See the [existing issues](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/projects/DAPT/issues) for things to start contributing.

For bigger changes, make sure you start a discussion first by creating
an issue and explaining the intended change.

All the pull requests and other changes will be accepted and merged by Atlassians.

Atlassian requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement,
known as a CLA. This serves as a record stating that the contributor is
entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project
and is willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works
(or is willing to transfer ownership).

Prior to accepting your contributions we ask that you please follow the appropriate
link below to digitally sign the CLA. The Corporate CLA is for those who are
contributing as a member of an organization and the individual CLA is for
those contributing as an individual.
